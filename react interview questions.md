Certainly! Here are 20 medium-complexity React interview questions along with their answers:

1. **What are React Fragments and why are they used?**
   - React Fragments allow you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are useful when a component needs to return multiple children elements without wrapping them in a parent element, thus avoiding unnecessary DOM nesting.

2. **How does React use the reconciliation algorithm?**
   - The reconciliation algorithm in React uses a heuristic method to efficiently update the UI by comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one. It identifies differences and applies the minimal number of DOM manipulations needed to update the UI.

3. **What is the purpose of `useMemo` and how does it differ from `useCallback`?**
   - `useMemo` is a hook that memoizes a computed value, recalculating it only when its dependencies change. `useCallback` is similar but memoizes a function instead of a value. `useCallback` is useful to avoid unnecessary re-renders when passing callback functions to child components.

4. **Explain how to handle forms in React using controlled components.**
   - Controlled components in React manage form state through React state. Input elements get their values from state and call `setState` on change events to update the state. This approach ensures that the form data is controlled by React.

5. **What are error boundaries and how do you use them in React?**
   - Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. They are created using either class components with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` methods or third-party libraries for functional components.

6. **How do you manage side effects in a Redux application?**
   - Side effects in Redux can be managed using middleware like `redux-thunk` for async logic or `redux-saga` for more complex scenarios involving long-running operations and complex workflows.

7. **What are the benefits of code splitting in a React application and how can it be implemented?**
   - Code splitting helps to improve the initial load time by splitting the app into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. It can be implemented using dynamic `import()` statements and React's `Suspense` and `lazy` features.

8. **Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs) and provide an example.**
   - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added functionality. They are used to reuse component logic. For example, a HOC can add authentication logic to a component to check if a user is logged in before rendering.

9. **What are render props and how do they differ from HOCs?**
   - Render props are a pattern for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. Unlike HOCs, which wrap components, render props involve passing a function to a component to control what gets rendered.

10. **How does the Context API handle updates and re-renders?**
    - The Context API triggers re-renders in all consuming components when the context value changes. To optimize, you can use `React.memo` or `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

11. **What is React's `StrictMode` and what are its benefits?**
    - `StrictMode` is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants, helping to identify unsafe lifecycle methods, deprecated APIs, and unexpected side effects.

12. **How do you implement server-side rendering (SSR) in React?**
    - SSR in React can be implemented using frameworks like Next.js, which provides built-in support for rendering React components on the server, sending the HTML to the client, and hydrating it to make it interactive.

13. **What is the significance of `key` prop in lists, and how does it affect rendering?**
    - The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. It significantly improves performance by enabling React to optimize re-rendering, as it uses keys to determine which items need to be updated.

14. **Explain the difference between `useReducer` and `useState`.**
    - `useState` is suitable for simple state logic, while `useReducer` is better for complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or complex state transitions. `useReducer` accepts a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

15. **What are portals in React and when would you use them?**
    - Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. They are useful for rendering modals, tooltips, or dropdowns where the content should visually break out of the parent container.

16. **How can you optimize a React application for performance?**
    - Performance optimizations include memoizing components with `React.memo`, using `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks, code splitting, lazy loading, avoiding anonymous functions in JSX, and using the `React.Profiler` API to measure performance.

17. **What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `useEffect` with an empty dependency array?**
    - Both `componentDidMount` and `useEffect` with an empty dependency array run once after the initial render. However, `useEffect` can also handle clean-up logic and can be re-run based on dependency changes.

18. **How do you handle routing in a React application?**
    - Routing in React is typically handled using libraries like React Router. It allows you to define routes and components that should be rendered for each route, handle dynamic routing, nested routes, and route parameters.

19. **What is PropTypes in React and why are they used?**
    - PropTypes is a type-checking library for React props. They are used to ensure that components receive props of the correct type, improving code reliability and maintainability by catching errors early.

20. **Explain how to use `React.memo` for optimization and its potential pitfalls.**
    - `React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes a component, preventing it from re-rendering unless its props change. While it can improve performance, overusing it or applying it incorrectly can lead
